# Solar System App

## Description

This Android application allows users to explore the solar system, starting from the universe, navigating to the galaxy, and then to the solar system, where they can click on planets to learn more about each one.

## Transitions between Activities

The app uses explicit intents to navigate between activities. Each activity has a corresponding layout file and Java class. Click listeners are implemented to start new activities when images or buttons are clicked. The Android back stack handles the navigation back to previous activities.
